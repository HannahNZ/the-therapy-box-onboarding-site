Development is a website development teams can use to help with:
- onboarding new team members
- making clear the culture/values they promote
- summarizing their workflow when starting - building - shipping products
- providing a cleary outlined list of technologies they use for developing projects
- passing knowledge to the next lead developer if projects exchange hands at some point
